Files in this folder are:
1. preprocess part (pre_process.py,convert_data.py) used for resizing images and transforming colorful images into black and white ones,
then create tfrecords files.

2.Helper functions for our model (layer_funcs.py, utils.py, model_freeze.py) used for building, testing and freezing model.

3.Main function for our model (model.py) used for training model and saving it.

These files can not be directly run unless you have images and put them in right directories.
